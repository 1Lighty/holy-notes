# holy-notes
 A Powercord plugin that lets you note messages.

I will not be working on this plugin (as I am banned from Powercord) anymore so I am putting it publically on github for anyone who wants to continue it. 

### Some quick notes:
The plugin will run if you copy all the files to your pc right now, but some thing are broken; the actual display of noted messages (accessible through a notebook icon button at the top of discord (same location as the multitask plugin)) is almost completly broken. Saving notes is fully functional, as well as all injections (I think). There is one (maybe two) missing injection(s), if you click the three dots on a message it shows a drop down with more options. I would've also added the note button to this menu (optional: add it to the message buttons as well but only when you shift click (like the new discord quick delete messages)) Currently, the way to save a note is to right click a message and click "Note Message", the message will then be saved to a 'notes.json' file located in the 'NotesHandler' folder.

I am also giving anyone full permission to do anything they want with this code, as well as strip any mentions of my name from it.

Oh, and to anyone who wants to maintain it, you should check with Kyza first as he's the one who wrote the Settings/NotesHandler for this plugin (originally in message translate)
